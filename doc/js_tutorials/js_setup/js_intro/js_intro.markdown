Introduction to OpenCV-JavaScript Tutorials {#tutorial_js_intro}
=======================================

OpenCV
------

OpenCV was started at Intel in 1999 by **Gary Bradsky**, and the first release came out in 2000.
**Vadim Pisarevsky** joined Gary Bradsky to manage Intel's Russian software OpenCV team. In 2005,
OpenCV was used on Stanley, the vehicle that won the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge. Later, its active
development continued under the support of Willow Garage with Gary Bradsky and Vadim Pisarevsky
leading the project. OpenCV now supports a multitude of algorithms related to Computer Vision and
Machine Learning and is expanding day by day.

OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages such as C++, Python, Java, etc., and is
available on different platforms including Windows, Linux, OS X, Android, and iOS. Interfaces for
high-speed GPU operations based on CUDA and OpenCL are also under active development.

OpenCV-JavaScript is the JavaScript API for OpenCV, combining the best qualities of the OpenCV C++ API and
the JavaScript language.
